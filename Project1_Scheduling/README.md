# Project 1: CPU Scheduling Simulation (FCFS & SJF)

This project simulates how an operating system schedules processes using two common CPU scheduling algorithms:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)** (non-preemptive)

The program reads a list of processes from a user-specified `.txt` file, simulates the scheduling behavior, and outputs:
- A **Gantt chart**
- **Waiting Time (WT)** and **Turnaround Time (TAT)** for each process
- **Average WT and TAT** for all processes
